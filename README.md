### Overview

Displaying lines using Bresenham's line algorithm. The VGA Core, provided by the University of Toronto, is used to interface with the monitor for displaying

### Lab Tasks

1. **Direct Operation:**
   - Utilize switches and buttons on your board to manually input pixel coordinates and colors.
   - Implement a VHDL block for direct pixel manipulation on a VGA screen.
2. **ModelSim Simulation:**
   - Test your implementation in ModelSim to ensure correct signal operation and output behavior.
3. **Automatic Operation - Line Drawing:**
   - Adapt your system to draw a line from the center of the display grid to a user-specified coordinate.
4. **Automatic Operation - Triangle Drawing:**
   - Extend the system to draw a triangle from the center to a designated point and back to the x-axis.
5. **Example output of a series of lines going towards the center**
